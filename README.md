# React-Router Intro Exercise

## Description

In this exercise, students gain experience with the fundamentals of ```react-router-dom```. Studnets are tasked with creating a "vending machine" web app, which features a home page for the machine, and three "items" (links) that a user can click on to view the item.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_router_intro_exercise.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory :

    ```bash
    cd react_router_intro_exercise
    ```

3. Install the dependencies :

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the app :

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

**The terminal window will display a ```Ctrl + click```-able link to the app*  

## Now What?

Click on the vending machine items. Click on the buttons that bring you back to the home page. Click the browser window's "back" and "forward" buttons. It should appear as though this app functions as anyone would expect. The key difference is client-side routing. You may notice that the page does not need to load between requests, even though the URL is updated. The ```react-router-dom``` package allows us to render what seems to be different pages, complete with browsing history, yet the app remains a single-page application.
